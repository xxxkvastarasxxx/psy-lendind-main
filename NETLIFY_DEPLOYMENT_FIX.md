# Netlify Deployment Fix - useSearchParams Suspense Boundary

## Issue Fixed
The Netlify deployment was failing with the error:
```
⨯ useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/"
```

## Root Cause
Next.js 15+ requires that `useSearchParams()` hook be wrapped in a Suspense boundary when used in pages that need to be statically generated. This is because `useSearchParams()` is a client-side hook that needs to wait for the browser to be available.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Suspense Import
```tsx
import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, Suspense } from "react";
```

### 2. Wrapped Main Component
The main page component is now structured as:
```tsx
export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingComponent />}>
      <LandingPageContent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function LandingPageContent() {
  // All the existing component code including useSearchParams()
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 3. Loading Fallback
Created a proper loading state that matches the site's design:
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100">
  <div className="text-center">
    <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-16 w-16 border-b-2 border-primary mx-auto mb-4"></div>
    <p className="text-primary/70 font-medium">Загрузка...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Why This Works

### Static Generation Compatibility
- The outer `LandingPage` component can be statically generated
- The inner `LandingPageContent` component with `useSearchParams()` is client-side only
- Suspense boundary tells Next.js to handle the client-side part separately

### User Experience
- Users see a loading spinner briefly while the client-side code loads
- The loading design matches the site's aesthetic
- No functionality is lost - all features work as before

### Build Process
- Next.js can now successfully build the static pages
- The build process no longer errors on the main page
- Netlify deployment will succeed

## Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Wrapped main component in Suspense boundary

## Testing
After this fix:
1. ✅ Build process completes successfully
2. ✅ Static pages generate correctly  
3. ✅ Client-side functionality works as expected
4. ✅ Payment cancellation handling still works
5. ✅ All existing features preserved

## Next.js Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Proper Suspense boundary usage
- ✅ Client-side hooks properly isolated
- ✅ Static generation compatibility maintained
- ✅ Graceful loading states provided

This fix ensures the site deploys successfully to Netlify while maintaining all existing functionality.
